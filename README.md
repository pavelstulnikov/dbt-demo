# dbt-demo
This repository is used for learning dbt in the form of a project that demonstrates a basic ELT process. The project and its code follow the dbt Fundamentals course provided by dbt.

In this project, customer, orders, and payments data from a public Amazon s3 bucket is loaded into Snowflake. The data is then transformed in dbt and stored back in a Snowflake data warehouse in the form of a data mart to be used for analytics.
